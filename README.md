# Lake-Victoria-Basin-Climate-data-analysis
A group of journalists reporting in the Nile Basin region has access to historic and projected rainfall and runoff data in the Lake Victoria Basin.  

The journalists seek to find out the trends in the data, past and future, summarize the findings and visualize the insights drawn from the dataset to tell a story of the climatic condition of the region.

This is where as an analyst I come in to interrogate the data and tell a story from it.
